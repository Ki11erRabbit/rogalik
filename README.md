Tiny set of Rust crates intended to help with 2D game creation.

**Very early release ;)**

Currently includes:
1. Engine - simple sprite based game engine (should support at least Win, Linux, Wasm and Android)
1. Events - uber simple generic event bus
1. Math - for now only 2D vectors
1. Storage - poor man's ECS (actually only EC)
1. Wgpu - wgpu graphics backend for the `engine` crate
